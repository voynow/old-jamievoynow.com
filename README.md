# Personal Portfolio and Project Chatbot

This repository contains the source code for a personal portfolio website. The main feature of the website is that it allows users to chat with a chatbot about the owner's pinned projects available on GitHub. The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 models to provide on-topic responses.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Here are the required dependencies for this project:

* Python 3.6 or higher (**`app.py`** and other Python scripts depend on Python 3.6+)

### Installing

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/voynow/jamievoynow.com.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional, but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
   ```
   GH_TOKEN=your_github_access_token
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

5. Run the app using Flask locally:
   ```
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run
   ```

Now, the portfolio website is running on your local machine at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Features

1. Personal portfolio displaying basic information and featured projects
2. A chatbot for each featured project, where users can ask questions and get on-topic responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3
3. The chatbot interface features real-time chat functionality using Flask-SocketIO, gevent, and websockets
4. Project information is cached using Flask-Caching
